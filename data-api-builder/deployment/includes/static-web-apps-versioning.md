# ☹️ Azure Static Web Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In November 2025, the Database Connection feature of Static Web Apps was retired. As a result, neither Data API builder nor SQL MCP Server are natively deployed into the Static Web Apps environment, and the `StaticWebApps` authentication provider in DAB is effectively deprecated and no longer supported.
