# ☹️ Azure Static Web Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In November 2025, the Database Connection feature of Static Web Apps was retired. As a result, Data API builder and SQL MCP Server aren't natively deployed into the Static Web Apps environment, and the `StaticWebApps` authentication provider in Data API builder is effectively deprecated and no longer supported.
