# Field selection (Projection) in GraphQL

In GraphQL, the fields you request define exactly what Data API builder (DAB) returnsâ€”no more, no less. DAB compiles these selections into parameterized SQL, including only the exposed columns and any foreign key fields required for relationships. Projection is governed by the entity configuration in `dab-config.json`.

> GraphQL has no wildcard like `SELECT *`. Clients must specify each field explicitly.

## Basic selection

Querying a few mapped fields.

#### GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  books {
    items {
      id
      title
      price
    }
  }
}
```

#### Conceptual SQL

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  sku_title AS title,
  sku_price AS price
FROM dbo.books;
```

#### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "books": {
      "items": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Dune",
          "price": 20
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Foundation",
          "price": 18
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Field aliases

Aliases rename fields in the response, not the database.

#### GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  books {
    items {
      bookTitle: title
      cost: price
    }
  }
}
```

#### Conceptual SQL

```sql
SELECT
  sku_title AS title,
  sku_price AS price
FROM dbo.books;
```

#### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "books": {
      "items": [
        {
          "bookTitle": "Dune",
          "cost": 20
        },
        {
          "bookTitle": "Foundation",
          "cost": 18
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Nested selection

Relationships defined in the configuration allow nested queries.

#### GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  books {
    items {
      id
      title
      category {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Conceptual SQL

```sql
SELECT
  b.id,
  b.sku_title AS title,
  c.id AS category_id,
  c.name AS category_name
FROM dbo.books AS b
JOIN dbo.categories AS c
  ON b.category_id = c.id;
```

#### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "books": {
      "items": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Dune",
          "category": {
            "id": 10,
            "name": "Sci-Fi"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Foundation",
          "category": {
            "id": 10,
            "name": "Sci-Fi"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## One-to-many selection

You can also traverse the inverse relationship when defined on the other entity.

#### GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  categories {
    items {
      id
      name
      books {
        items {
          id
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Conceptual SQL

```sql
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  b.id AS book_id,
  b.sku_title AS title
FROM dbo.categories AS c
JOIN dbo.books AS b
  ON c.id = b.category_id;
```

#### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "categories": {
      "items": [
        {
          "id": 10,
          "name": "Sci-Fi",
          "books": {
            "items": [
              { "id": 1, "title": "Dune" },
              { "id": 2, "title": "Foundation" }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination with projection

Projection and pagination combine seamlessly.

#### GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  books(first: 3) {
    items {
      id
      title
    }
    hasNextPage
    endCursor
  }
}
```

#### Conceptual SQL

```sql
SELECT TOP (3)
  id,
  sku_title AS title
FROM dbo.books
ORDER BY id ASC;
```

#### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "books": {
      "items": [
        { "id": 1, "title": "Dune" },
        { "id": 2, "title": "Foundation" },
        { "id": 3, "title": "Hyperion" }
      ],
      "hasNextPage": true,
      "endCursor": "eyJpZCI6M30="
    }
  }
}
```

## Relevant configuration

To control selection, configure `mappings` and `relationships` under `entities`.

```jsonc
{
  "entities": {
    "Book": {
      "source": {
        "object": "dbo.books",
        "type": "table"
      },
      "mappings": {
        "sku_title": "title",
        "sku_price": "price"
      },
      "relationships": {
        "book_category": {
          "cardinality": "one",
          "target.entity": "Category",
          "source.fields": [
            "category_id"
          ],
          "target.fields": [
            "id"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "Category": {
      "source": {
        "object": "dbo.categories",
        "type": "table"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
