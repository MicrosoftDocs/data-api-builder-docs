# DAB docs authoring guide (agent)

This guide teaches an agent how to author Data API builder documentation that is:

- Structurally consistent with existing DAB docs.
- Terse, clear, and grammatically consistent.
- Comprehensive (covers the full CLI surface area).
- Compliant with Microsoft Learn/DocFX build validations.

## Non-negotiables

- Follow the existing page’s structure and tone. Don’t invent a new format.
- Keep content terse and scannable; prefer tables and short examples.
- If a change would alter meaning or product behavior, don’t do it without user confirmation.
- Don’t introduce new UI/UX, new sections, or extra narrative when a page already uses a pattern.

## Operating mode

- Persist until the request is fully resolved end-to-end.
- For non-trivial work, create a TODO list and complete one step at a time.
- Before each tool call, say (in one sentence) what you’re about to do and why.

When you must show the TODO list in chat, use this exact format:

```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: ...
- [ ] Step 2: ...
```

## Authoring workflow for CLI reference pages

### 1) Inventory the CLI surface area

- Obtain the authoritative option list from the CLI help output: `dab <command> --help`.
- Create a checklist of:
  - Positional arguments.
  - Flags (including aliases like `-c, --config`).
  - Allowed enums and constraints.

If the CLI help doesn’t enumerate allowed values, validate via the DAB config schema (and/or a real CLI run) before documenting them.

### 2) Make the page complete

- Update the **Quick glance** table so it includes every supported option.
- Ensure each option in Quick glance has a matching section:
  - Heading format: `## --flag` or `## -s, --source`.
  - One short description sentence.
  - `### Example`

### 3) Keep opening examples “fast-start”

- Keep “Quick examples” minimal, runnable, and using only the command being documented.

### 4) Don’t guess JSON shapes

- Prefer JSON shapes that already exist in this repo’s reference docs.
- If you include “Resulting config” JSON, it must be copied from a config generated by the CLI (not hand-authored).

## Examples format (CLI)

- Use fenced code blocks with an explicit language (`bash`, `cmd`, `json`, `http`).
- Prefer multi-line commands over one-liners.
- For DAB CLI examples, include both Bash and Windows Command Prompt using Learn conceptual tabs:

```markdown
#### [Bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
dab <command> \
  --flag value
```

#### [Command Prompt](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
dab <command> ^
  --flag value
```

---
```

## Validation and quality gates (Markdown-only)

- Validate changes frequently.
- Treat DocFX build warnings as blocking, especially:
  - Broken links
  - `bookmark-not-found` (broken `#anchor` links)

If you change headings/anchors in commonly-linked pages (for example, `data-api-builder/command-line/*.md`), also do a repo-wide search for inbound links and update them.
